### Geography 

I live in the the greatest city on the planet, the dirty Oceanside. The moment I moved here, I knew I had always been here in my heart. 

### Reading 

Some of my favorite books are: 

- *KJV Bible* by God
- *KJV Matthew* by Matthew (but really by God)
- *KJV Mark* by Mark (also by God)
- *KJV Luke* by Luke (yet again by God)
- *KJV John* by John (this one's not by God) (Ha! Just kidding, it 100% is by God as well)

### Personality

My personality is nothing short of *cool.* I'm a hype man, but more lowkey than John Peck. I'd prefer fishing for a 2 lbs Bass than for a 10 lbs Calico. **SURFING** is life. **FISHING** is life. **DIRT BIKE RIDING** is life. (But **Jesus** is the real life).    


## Food

Almost nothing beats Fraser Farms. But since we've been living in this stupid quarantine (see ![image](https://giphy.com/explore/were-all-gonna-die) for how the world is reacting) has got all the restaurants closed, so honestly, I just wish I could eat at: 

- King's Hawaiian Restaurant 
- Jack's stack
- Bear Flag Fish Co. 

 
People, hug your babies, hug your wife, pet your dog, but then shower because of **COVID.**
