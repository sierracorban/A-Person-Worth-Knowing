### Geography 

I live in the the greatest city on the planet, the dirty Oceanside. The moment I moved here, I knew I had always been here in my heart. 

### Reading 

Some of my favorite books are: 

- *KJV Bible* by God
- *KJV Matthew* by Matthew (but really by God)
- *KJV Mark* by Mark (also by God)
- *KJV Luke* by Luke (yet again by God)
- *KJV John* by John (this one's not by God) (Ha! Just kidding, it 100% is by God as well)

### Personality

My personality is nothing short of *cool.* I'm a hype man, but more lowkey than John Peck. I'd prefer fishing for a 2 lbs Bass than for a 10 lbs Calico. **SURFING** is life. **FISHING** is life. **DIRT BIKE RIDING** is life. (But **Jesus** is the real life).    


### Food

Almost nothing beats Fraser Farms. But since living in this stupid quarantine (see [link](https://giphy.com/explore/were-all-gonna-die) for how the world is reacting) has got all the restaurants closed, I honestly just wish I could eat at: 

- King's Hawaiian Restaurant 
- Jack's stack
- Bear Flag Fish Co. 

### Fun Fact

I might get a duck. 

### Another Fun Fact 

I have an amazing girlfriend, who thinks I'm the strongest, most handsome guy on the Good Lord's green earth. She likes me a lot, and especially likes it when I hug her tight. She misses me when I'm gone (kinda never want me to leave). She's not very good at cooking, but she uses butter, so her food always tastes better than mine (except for when I grill; she loves it when I grill; she says nothing turns her on more than a good-likin' man grillin'). She loves that I love the Lord; but boy does her face light up when I pull up in my truck and cowboy hat to pick her up. She ain't ever met anyone more adventurous, and she loves the thrill I bring to her life. She's an artist, an acrobat, and a poet, and she won't stop talking about babies, but that's how it is with women when they meet a good man; they start thinking about babies. She's cool, and she thinks I'm cool.  

### Words of Wisdom 
People, hug your babies, hug your wife, pet your dog, see your church friends, but then shower because of **COVID.**

And get right with the Man. ([VZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHaJegv6Sjs))
